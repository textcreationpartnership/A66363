            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2.

               </note> where he ſaw five of his houſhold Servants, four men and a maid, of ſixteen years of age, killed, before his face, and ſo had he been ſlain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, had he not ſhut the Iron Grate of his Caſtle, and kept the

            <p>And yet not long after one <hi>Martin</hi> an Engliſh Pirate did moſt falſly accuſe him of many hainous crimes, as the putting down of the Maſs in <hi>England,</hi> cauſed Doctor <hi>Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to be impriſoned, and poyſoned the King, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other hainous things, which brought him abundance of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and vexations with the Captain of the ſhip wherein he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards <hi>Holland,</hi> as himſelf relateth at large, from <hi>fol.</hi> 38. of his Book of his perſecution unto <hi>fol.</hi> 42.</p>
            <p>And becauſe they are ſo fully exemplified and expreſſed by himſelf there, together with the reſt of his troubles and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which he had in <hi>Oſſory,</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in his paſſage by Sea towards <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Book that himſelf printed, of his Vocation to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and his perſecution in the ſame, I will ſet no more down here, but refer my Reader to that Book.</p>

            <p>After this I continued in my <hi>poor</hi> houſe untill <hi>I</hi> had finiſhed my <hi>Great Antichriſt,</hi> and then <hi>I</hi> ſhewed it to very many of my friends, whom <hi>I</hi> durſt truſt, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and told

               <hi>the printing of it is like to be much to the damage of the Printer, and the ruin of the Author, (if he be found out) and little credit, in my opinion, is ſo like to gain thereby.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> durſt not <hi>venter</hi> to print it by any means; yet, if I could have had <hi>any other</hi> to print it, I would have done it, and reſolved to have <hi>fled</hi> into the Low Countries when it had been done; but it could not be, that <hi>any Stationer</hi> would venture to do it; ſo I went to <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when I heard that Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> was riſen in <hi>Cheſhire;</hi> and was ſo <hi>near</hi> the time that I expected and <hi>foreſhewed</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties reſtauration, I took a <hi>young Philly</hi> that I had of three years old, and in a very cold ſnow and froſt in <hi>January,</hi> I went ſoft and fair towards <hi>London,</hi> hoping that now, ſo <hi>many men</hi> looking after the coming in of our King, and Collonel <hi>Monk</hi> expected to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, I ſhould have my <hi>Great Antichriſt</hi> publiſhed; yet ſtill the <hi>Rump</hi> was ſo ſtrong, that it could not be: therefore I was fain to <hi>retire</hi> towards <hi>Wales</hi> again; and going from my houſe by <hi>Toceſter,</hi> where I had left my <hi>Mare,</hi> ſome ten miles, in a <hi>froſty</hi> morning, a foot, I afterwards went a horſe-back, but had not rid one <hi>quarter</hi> of a mile, but my <hi>Mare,</hi> whom all my Neighbours there ſaid ſhe was <hi>great with foal,</hi> lay down under me; and I, fearing ſhe would <hi>caſt</hi> her Foale, and ſo perhaps <hi>loſe</hi> my Mare, or forced to <hi>leave</hi> her behind me, was reſolved to <hi>lead</hi> her in my hand; and ſo I did from that place, which was <hi>Daintry,</hi> to my <hi>houſe</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> about ſeven ſcore miles, the way being <hi>ſomewhat fair</hi> in the latter end of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, having ſome occaſions to go to <hi>Ireland,</hi> being at <hi>Holy Head,</hi> I had notice with the <hi>Poſt,</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> that the Parliament, according as I found in Scripture, had <hi>voted</hi> the coming in of the King, and I, landing in <hi>Dublin</hi> about ſeven

            <p>But one of my Countrymen had begg'd of his Majeſty the <hi>Deanery of Bangor;</hi> yet, when I informed his Majeſty, that my good King and <hi>gracious Maſter,</hi> his Father, had conferred it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, to hold it <hi>in commendum,</hi> ſo firm as <hi>Law</hi> could make it; his Majeſty was <hi>moſt graciouſly</hi> pleaſed preſently to ſend to Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas</hi> to <hi>recall</hi> the Grant that he had made to Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> but the ſame being paſt to the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> my <hi>Lord Chancellour,</hi> to whom I ever was <hi>very much</hi> obliged, knowing my <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to my late King and beſt Maſter, and my <hi>ſufferings</hi> for him, did <hi>moſt honourably</hi> ſtop it, before I could come unto his Lordſhip; and ſo by his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and my Lord <hi>Chancellours</hi> goodneſs, I ſtill enjoyed my Maſters favour.</p>
            <p>Then, things being <hi>ſomewhat</hi> ſetled, I went to live upon my Biſhoprick, in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where I found the <hi>Cathedral</hi> Church and the <hi>Biſhops houſe</hi> all ruined, and nothing ſtanding but the <hi>bare walls,</hi> without <hi>Roofs,</hi> without <hi>Windows,</hi> but the holes, and without <hi>doors;</hi> yet I reſolved <hi>preſently</hi> to mend and repair <hi>one Room,</hi> and to live in the <hi>Biſhops houſe,</hi> and as I had vowed, that

               </note> and yet a thouſand pounds more will not ſufficiently repair that Church, which I vowed to beſtow, If I recover the Biſhops houſe, and live to it; and a great deal of coſt more I laid out upon the <hi>Biſhops houſe.</hi> Yet now began my <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> which grieves me much more than my <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> becauſe my perſecution was <hi>perſonal,</hi> and concerned my ſelf <hi>alone:</hi> but mine <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> doth now reach to the <hi>diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of God, and the robbing of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> of his ſervice, and the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of his Servants; when as the Church of Chriſt cannot be <hi>ruled</hi> without Governours, nor <hi>inſtructed</hi> without Teachers, and neither of them can <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> without mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>And yet now <hi>Noblemen</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Souldiers and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and all, think no <hi>Bread</hi> ſo ſweet, no <hi>Wine</hi> ſo pleaſant as that which they <hi>ſnatch</hi> from the <hi>Altar,</hi> and no <hi>Land</hi> ſo fertile as that which they hold from the <hi>Church,</hi> and keep it by <hi>force</hi> from the Church-men; and to give you a <hi>taſte</hi> of this truth, I have printed a <hi>Narrative</hi> and a true Relation of a <hi>Law proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> betwixt my ſelf and Sir <hi>George Ayskue,</hi> a civil Gentleman, I confeſs, and one that hath been <hi>Vice-Admiral</hi> to the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but now is <hi>very faithful</hi> to our preſent King, and <hi>ſorry</hi> for what he hath been, as I <hi>verily</hi> believe, and is a man of a <hi>very fair</hi> carriage, and of very good parts; yet bewitched with the <hi>diſguiſed ſpirit</hi> of Sacriledge, to hold faſt in his hands the <hi>Lands</hi> of the Church, and not only he, but <hi>many others</hi> are ſick of the ſame diſeaſe, as appeareth by the <hi>ſubſequent</hi> of this relation.</p>

Burges,</hi> for their <hi>forcible entry;</hi> but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, being removed by a <hi>Certiorari</hi> to the Kings Bench, though I had retained <hi>two Counſellors,</hi> and gave them twenty ſhillings for their Fee, to do things <hi>right,</hi> and according to Law, yet through the <hi>errour</hi> of the Clerke, there were <hi>ſome faults</hi> found in the Indictment, and ſo the ſame was <hi>quaſht</hi> by the Judges of the Kings Bench: Then I got the <hi>beſt Attourney</hi> that I thought was in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and is ſo <hi>reputed</hi> by all my friends, to draw me <hi>another Indictment</hi> againſt the foreſaid <hi>forcible enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> and being drawn, I carried it to Sir <hi>William Donvil,</hi> the Kings <hi>Atturney,</hi> and gave him his Fee to <hi>review</hi> it, and mend it, if any thing was amiſs in it, and make it ſo, as it might ſtand <hi>good</hi> in Law, the which thing, he <hi>very carefully</hi> did, and amended <hi>ſome</hi> things with his own hands: And I knew not what I could or ſhould do <hi>more,</hi> to draw a <hi>good</hi> Indictment.</p>
            <p>Then I deſired the <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the Peace, to ſend <hi>a precipe,</hi> to the Sheriffe to ſummon a Jury to examine the <hi>force,</hi> which they did, upon the ſaid place, where the <hi>force</hi> was committed.</p>
            <p>And, though Sir <hi>George Ayskue</hi> had for his Atturney, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the now <hi>High Sheriffe</hi> of the County of the City of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> the Recorder of the City of <hi>Kilken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> for his Counſellour, to <hi>plead</hi> againſt the finding of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment true, as much as ever they could, and <hi>another</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour ſtood againſt it, as <hi>much,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> than either of them both; and I had neither Atturney nor Counſellour to ſay any thing for it, but what the <hi>Witneſses</hi> proved; yet the Jury did <hi>preſently</hi> find it <hi>Billa Vera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I deſired the Juſtices of the Peace to reſtore me to my <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> but to prevent the ſame, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Sir <hi>George Ayskues</hi> Atturney, having a <hi>Certiorari</hi> ready in his Pocket, did <hi>immediately,</hi> as ſoon as ever the Jury had brought in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, deliver the ſame into the hands of the <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the Peace, and they delivered it to the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the Peace, and the Juſtices ſaid, that now they could not <hi>reſtore</hi> me to my Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe that their hands were <hi>ſtopt,</hi> and all the proceedings muſt be <hi>tranſmitted</hi> to the Kings Bench, by <hi>Octab. Hillarii.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106658:12"/>
            <p>And when I came to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> I went to the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the Peace, and examined the <hi>ſame</hi> Indictment, which the Jury found (and which I had done before) <hi>ad amuſſim,</hi> very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, with <hi>that Copy,</hi> which the Kings Atturney had <hi>amended,</hi> and averred to be ſufficient; and I prayed the <hi>Clerke</hi> of the Peace, to give me a <hi>Copy</hi> of that Indictment, which the Jury found, the which he did under his hand, and I examined <hi>all</hi> again, and found them in all things to be <hi>verbatim,</hi> word for word agreeable one to another.</p>
            <p>Then by <hi>Octab. Hillarii,</hi> the time <hi>ſet,</hi> to return the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Kings Bench, I went to <hi>Dublin:</hi> But there was no Indictment <hi>returned;</hi> ſtill I expected, but ſtill in vain; At laſt I complained to the Lords Juſtices; but they anſwered, that they could not <hi>help</hi> it, for they <hi>knew</hi> not, whether the <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orari</hi> was delivered or not: At laſt, ſeeing it was neither <hi>return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> nor <hi>like</hi> to be returned, I was adviſed to make <hi>Affidavit,</hi> that I had <hi>ſeen</hi> it delivered into the hands of the Juſtices of the Peace, and that I <hi>heard</hi> it read, and then ſaw it delivered to the <hi>Clerke</hi> of the Peace; and then upon the reading of my <hi>Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi> and a <hi>motion</hi> made by my <hi>Counſel</hi> thereupon; there was an <hi>Order</hi> ſet down, that there ſhould be 20 <hi>li.</hi> fine ſet upon the <hi>Clerke</hi> of the Peace, if the proceedings and the <hi>Indictment</hi> came not in by ſuch a day; So, at laſt, it came in, but it was the <hi>laſt day</hi> of the Term that it came into the Court; and then the Kings <hi>Sergeant</hi> moved for my <hi>poſſeſſion;</hi> but the Counſel, on the other ſide, <hi>pleaded,</hi> that there was an <hi>errour</hi> in the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment; and being ſomewhat <hi>long</hi> in alledging the Caſes of <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and of <hi>John an Oakes</hi> and <hi>John a Stile,</hi> the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> told him, it was the <hi>laſt day</hi> of the Term, and Motions were to be heard: Therefore ſeeing they could not <hi>hear out</hi> the Matter now, they ſhould ſhew <hi>cauſe</hi> by the ſecond day of the next Term why <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> ſhould not be reſtored.</p>
            <p>Then I thought this was to keep me <hi>long enough</hi> out of my Poſſeſſion, and to let Sir <hi>George Ayskue</hi> have <hi>one half</hi> years rent more, to the <hi>two half</hi> years Rent that he had already, ſince I was driven out of my Poſſeſſion, and to let his Counſel have <hi>time e ough</hi> added, to what they had already, to pick as many
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106658:13"/> holes as they could <hi>find,</hi> or could <hi>make</hi> in mine Indictment, but, conſidering that, as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Levius fit patientia quicquid corrigere eſt nefas,</hi> I went away, and ſaid nothing.</p>
            <p>But upon the ſecond day of the <hi>next</hi> Term, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the <hi>hearing</hi> of it, the Kings <hi>Atturney</hi> moved for poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and the Counſel of the other ſide began to plead the <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> of the Indictment, but the pleading was <hi>preſently</hi> put off, and it was proſecuted the next day: The Kings Atturney being not there; and the main errour, that was of any moment, and which was neither ſeen nor toucht the Term before by Sir <hi>George</hi> his Counſel; (for all <hi>other things</hi> alledged, as my Counſel ſaid, were but <hi>trifles,</hi> &amp; could <hi>eaſily</hi> be anſwered) was, that in the Indictment it was ſaid, <hi>Per Sacramentum quindecem virorum,</hi> whereas it ſhould be <hi>Per Sacramentum proborum &amp; legalium ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum comitatus Kilken-predict. extitit. preſentat.</hi> which words were <hi>all</hi> left out of the Indictment, and the other words put in the room of them; Then I ſtood up and ſaid, I was <hi>certain,</hi> the words <hi>quindecim virorum</hi> were not in the Indictment that was found by the Jury, and that <hi>all the other words</hi> were in it; becauſe that <hi>my ſelf</hi> had examined it, and <hi>read</hi> it, and had likewiſe a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> of it, under the hand of the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the Peace, which was examined with the <hi>Original</hi> by my ſelf: And I offered in open Court to make <hi>Oath</hi> of all this; but the Lords Juſtices anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they could not proceed but according to <hi>the Record,</hi> that was <hi>returned</hi> to the Court, which they muſt conceive to be the <hi>true Record;</hi> And I anſwered, That I hoped they would not judge according to <hi>that Record,</hi> which I would <hi>ſwear</hi> was falſe and corrupted, and not the <hi>true Record,</hi> nor according to the Record that was found by the Jury; yet I could not prevail to have the <hi>Clerke</hi> of the Peace ſent for, and to bring the <hi>original Record</hi> to be ſhewed in the Court, therefore by the <hi>next day</hi> I brought this <hi>Affidavit</hi> in writing:

Therefore I have <hi>no reaſon</hi> for the biting of a <hi>mad</hi> Dog, to hang all the <hi>good</hi> Dogs in the Countrey, or for the abuſe or injuſtice done me by ſome one man or few Lawyers, to exclaim againſt <hi>all others,</hi> when as the Poet adviſeth us, <hi>Parcere paucorum diffun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere crimen in omnes.</hi> But I do <hi>exceedingly</hi> tax my ſelf, and mine own <hi>underſtanding,</hi> that underſtanding both Greek and Latine, and having read what <hi>Lambert, Bolton</hi> and <hi>Dalton</hi> have written of <hi>Forcible Entries,</hi> I ſhould be ſuch a <hi>Dolt,</hi> as not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>this Proceeding</hi> of mine, about the <hi>Indictment</hi> of thoſe <hi>Forcible Enterers</hi> to be a <hi>juſt</hi> and a fair Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Therefore mine apprehenſion conceiving ſuch proceedings to be <hi>foul,</hi> and very much amiſs, and that the <hi>justice</hi> which I had, upon the whole matter, had not what <hi>Pindarus</hi> ſaith <hi>Juſtice</hi> uſeth to have, that is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I thought <hi>good,</hi> to ſet down the <hi>ſame,</hi> not to <hi>accuſe,</hi> and complain againſt any one for being unjuſt, or to ſeek any <hi>redreſs</hi> unto my ſelf; for I have <hi>born,</hi> and can be <hi>contented</hi> ſtill to bear, more wrongs than this: But I do it for theſe ends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To let <hi>poor men</hi> ſee, how they may be <hi>wronged</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and have their Land and <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> taken from them by <hi>great</hi> and powerful men, and what they are beſt to do in ſuch a caſe; and my counſel is, to be <hi>patient,</hi> becauſe as I ſaid before, <hi>Levius fit patientia quicquid corrigere eſt nefas,</hi> and as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If any man ſue thee for thy Coat, let him have thy Cloak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;</hi> So I ſay, if any <hi>great man,</hi> that hath a great <hi>Place,</hi> or great <hi>Friends,</hi> take away thy <hi>Lands,</hi> let him take away thy Houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, rather then ſpend thy <hi>Money,</hi> and loſe that with thy Lands; for as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If theſe things be done to the green tree,</hi> what ſhall be done <hi>to the dry?</hi> So if theſe Proceedings <hi>paſs</hi> againſt <hi>me,</hi> that can both <hi>speak</hi> and follow my buſineſſe to the <hi>uttermoſt,</hi> and, I thank God have <hi>ability</hi> to go through with it, what ſhall become of <hi>thee,</hi> and thy <hi>Cauſe,</hi> that art a <hi>poor</hi> man, when thou ſwimmeſt againſt the <hi>ſtream,</hi> and kickeſt againſt the <hi>pricks?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I <hi>adviſe</hi> thee, rather in ſuch a caſe, to cry to <hi>God,</hi> than complain to any Judge, leſt that as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106658:16"/> medicina modum,</hi> thy <hi>remedy</hi> will prove worſe than thy <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</hi> For thou ſeeſt how I am <hi>ſerved,</hi> put out of my <hi>Houſe,</hi> and ſpend above 60 <hi>li.</hi> and have <hi>no redreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If this <hi>proceeding</hi> and dealing with me, be, as I conceive it, not <hi>ſo fair</hi> and ſo <hi>juſt</hi> as it ſhould be, both for the <hi>King</hi> and my ſelf, that am ejected out of my Houſe and Lands; then I conceive, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould, to prevent the <hi>like Oppreſſion</hi> and wrongs to poor men, provide an <hi>eaſier</hi> and plainer way to <hi>relieve</hi> the oppreſſed, and to ſet down an uſual Form of Indictment, or to cauſe that the <hi>Indictments</hi> ſhould not be ſo <hi>eaſily</hi> and ſo <hi>frequently,</hi> upon every Lawyers motion, <hi>quaſht,</hi> as they are reported to be: Eſpecially when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Force</hi> is plain and evidently proved. And this redreſs of Injuries I petition and <hi>move</hi> for, for theſe four ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the <hi>difficulty</hi> of framing the Indictments ſo, that a cunning Lawyer cannot <hi>eaſily</hi> find a fault, and a flaw in it, and then the <hi>frequent</hi> quaſhing of ſuch Indictments, as are found faulty, is a great wrong to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> in depriving him of thoſe Fines that otherwiſe are <hi>due,</hi> and ſhould be <hi>rendered</hi> unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>great Abuſe</hi> and injury unto the poor <hi>Subject,</hi> that ſhall be driven out of his <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> and, for want of a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Clerke or Counſellour to draw the <hi>right form</hi> of his Indictment, (which as I ſee few can do) he ſhall both ſpend his <hi>Money,</hi> and loſe his <hi>labour;</hi> and perhaps, he is not <hi>able</hi> to do as I did, three or four times to draw Indictments, till he finds one that may ſtand good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This <hi>frequent</hi> quaſhing of Indictments is a great <hi>encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for Oppreſſors, and wicked men to <hi>wrong</hi> their neighbours more and more; for ſay they, I will enter upon him and thruſt him out, and if he doth <hi>indite</hi> me, I will remove it to the Kings Bench, and I ſhall find a Lawyer that will <hi>quaſh</hi> his Indictment by and by.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This <hi>very practiſe</hi> and proceeding may be feared to prove the very <hi>bane</hi> and deſtruction of whole Nations and Kingdoms: For if Righteouſneſs <hi>exalteth a Nation,</hi> and a Kingdom is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106658:16"/> from one Nation to another People, <hi>becauſe of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, and as we may read it in all Hiſtories. Then you may ſee how requiſite it is, for Kings and Princes, to look to thoſe things, and not to ſuffer <hi>unrighteous Judges,</hi> either for <hi>favour</hi> to one, or <hi>hatred</hi> to another, to do what they liſt, and to make their Laws like a <hi>Noſe of Wax,</hi> to bend which way they pleaſe, or like a <hi>Spiders Web,</hi> that catcheth the <hi>ſmall Flies,</hi> but is broken, by the great <hi>humble Bees,</hi> all to pieces; but to be like the Chancellour <hi>Steel,</hi> that although he hated my perſon, yet, he ſaid, though I deſerved it not, I ſhould have Juſtice, and ſo he did me Juſtice preſently, and I love to do right to my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and to ſay the truth of mine enemy.</p>
            <p>But for my ſelf, I thank God for it, as I lived <hi>many years</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quietly and contentedly with far <hi>leſs means</hi> then 20 <hi>li.</hi> a year, and with far leſs pains and troubles then I have now, ſo I doubt not, but I could live ſo ſtill; and I reſolved and vowed, as I have atteſted in my Epiſtle to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that, if I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this <hi>Biſhops Court</hi> unto the Church, I would <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> beſtow the ſame for the repairing of the <hi>Cathedral</hi> Church of <hi>Kilkenny:</hi> So that <hi>recovering</hi> it, I ſhould not be one Penny the richer, or <hi>not recovering</hi> it, not a Penny the poorer; and ſo the wrong done by this <hi>Proceeding,</hi> whoſoever did it, is, as I conceive, more againſt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> than againſt my ſelf. And if the <hi>Proviſo</hi> for Sir <hi>George Ayskue</hi> carrieth this <hi>Biſhops Court</hi> to him from the <hi>Church,</hi> which in my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is clean <hi>contrary</hi> to the very words of the Act, <hi>pag.</hi> 72. Let him pray that he hath it not with that <hi>Sauce</hi> which God preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. And ſo I end, and ſo be it, as God pleaſeth, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after I had <hi>delivered</hi> this ſame Relation unto his Majeſty, and ſhewed the <hi>Effect</hi> and ſum thereof, by the next day I gave him this <hi>Petition.</hi>

            <p>I know not <hi>what more</hi> I could have deſired; his Majeſty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doing <hi>more</hi> then I deſired: And when I was <hi>very willing</hi> to have given 5 <hi>l.</hi> in Gold for Sir <hi>Henry Bennets</hi> Fee, that moſt <hi>Courteous</hi> Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Quod-dolphin,</hi> ſaid, I ſhould not pay <hi>one penny,</hi> but Sir <hi>Henry</hi> would lay that upon the <hi>Church,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Canterburies</hi> ſcore: So fairly, and ſo <hi>friendly</hi> was I uſed at his Majeſties Court: The Lord <hi>bleſs</hi> them, and <hi>reward</hi> them for it; and grant them <hi>alwaies</hi> the like Favour as I found with them.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">But I fear that the favour which Sir <hi>Geo.

            <p n="4">4.

            <p>And when <hi>each one</hi> of them had made his Oration, and ſpent <hi>much</hi> time, and my Lord Chief Juſtice heard them, with a <hi>great deal</hi> of patience, to prove what I <hi>never denied,</hi> but was ready to <hi>confeſs</hi> all that they ſaid, touching the <hi>large</hi> Writings and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, that they produced, to prove the <hi>Title</hi> and Intereſt of Mr. <hi>Robert Shea</hi> to this Biſhops Court, which <hi>at this time,</hi> when

            <p>But for Sir <hi>George Ayskue,</hi> that for his Service,<note place="margin">How S. <hi>George Ayskue</hi> came to have this Biſhops Court.</note> you know to whom, (which makes me believe it will never proſper with him) had a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from the Uſurper <hi>Crumwel,</hi> that for 200 <hi>li.</hi> which was <hi>due</hi> unto him for ſome Service that he had done, as I am informed, the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> ſhould allot him <hi>ſo much</hi> Lands, as they thought worth 200 <hi>li.</hi> and they out of <hi>favour</hi> to him, and getting Lands ſo <hi>cheap</hi> as they did, gave him this <hi>Biſhops Court,</hi> and ſo much <hi>more</hi> other Lands, as are now far <hi>better worth</hi> than 200 <hi>li. per annum;</hi> his Counſel ſaid <hi>never a word</hi> touching his Title and Intereſt; for he injoyed it not <hi>peaceably</hi> and quietly, but only during the time of the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and Uſurpation, (which I conceive to be no <hi>true Poſſeſſion,</hi>) for as ſoon <hi>as ever</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was <hi>ſo happily</hi> reſtored before one year had gone about, I ſent to enter upon it, and to <hi>diſtrain</hi> for my Rent, and Captain <hi>Burges,</hi> Sir <hi>George Ayskues</hi> prime Tenant, gave me a <hi>Writing,</hi> which I have to ſhew, under his hand, to become <hi>anſwerable</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me for the whole Rent of this <hi>Biſhops Court</hi> and <hi>Freſhfoord,</hi> when I ſhould be peaceably ſetled in it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Then my Lord of <hi>Santry,</hi> that is, my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Counſel <hi>ſilent,</hi> began moſt <hi>nobly, rightly,</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> as a moſt <hi>upright</hi> Judge, and like himſelf in <hi>all</hi> his judgements, told the <hi>Jury,</hi> that for the <hi>title and matter of Law,</hi> and the Intereſt of either in this <hi>Biſhops Court,</hi> it was not in <hi>their charge</hi> to inquire of it, but they, that were the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Law, and of the right intereſt were to do it, and would do the ſame, when my <hi>Counſel</hi> ſhould move for the <hi>poſſeſsion,</hi> but they were, for the King, to enquire <hi>only</hi> of the matter <hi>of fact</hi> and <hi>force;</hi> whether <hi>after</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion was given to the Biſhop by the Sheriff, by vertue of an <hi>Order</hi> of the houſe of Lords, and the Biſhop <hi>continued</hi> his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion from <hi>April</hi> to the eighth of <hi>October,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The which ſaid he, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor ſhould not forcibly be put out.</note> though he ſhould be a <hi>Diſſeiſor,</hi> yet was he not <hi>forcibly</hi> put out, and kept out of the ſame? This was their <hi>only charge,</hi> to inquire after: and for this, ſaid my Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> you ſee what is proved; a <hi>multitude of perſons,</hi> ten or twelve at the leaſt, when as <hi>one</hi> may make a forcible entry; you heard alſo, ſaid he, what <hi>weapons</hi> they had, <hi>Gun, Pike, Sword,</hi> and <hi>Staves;</hi> and you heard what <hi>threatning

            <p>So the <hi>Jury</hi> was <hi>diſmiſt;</hi> and all that heard the <hi>evidence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sure, if I had not been a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop they would never have given ſuch a Verdict.</note> and what my Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, would have laid, ſome <hi>twenty</hi> to one, ſome <hi>forty</hi> to one, and ſome a <hi>hundred</hi> to one, that the <hi>Jury</hi> would not ſtand upon it, but <hi>preſently</hi> find the Verdict for the King.

            <p>Indeed, for the Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory</hi> he underſtands their <hi>malice</hi> towards him, well enough, (I pray God <hi>forgive</hi> them) ſo <hi>great,</hi> that, were it not for ſome <hi>honeſt,</hi> and truly religious <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and ſome of the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> I profeſs that I durſt not live amongſt <hi>theſe,</hi> that <hi>formerly</hi> warred againſt their King, and if the <hi>truth</hi> were known, do as I believe, as <hi>little</hi> love their <hi>preſent</hi> King, as they do <hi>much</hi> hate our <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> of our Church: when as they that <hi>hate</hi> their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> cannot be ſaid to <hi>honour</hi> their <hi>King,</hi> as I have moſt <hi>fully</hi> ſhewed in my <hi>Grand Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore I went unto his <hi>grace,</hi> my Lord Lieutenant, and related to his Grace the <hi>Verdict</hi> of the Jury, plain <hi>contrary</hi> to their evidence and the <hi>Declaration</hi> of my Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> and the Judgement of the <hi>whole Court;</hi> and therefore did moſt <hi>humbly</hi> deſire his Grace, to give me <hi>leave</hi> to go for <hi>England,</hi> to diſpatch ſome <hi>neceſſary</hi> occaſions, and to ſignifie unto his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> that, if there were no Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> here, nor any <hi>other</hi> proviſion made, to puniſh all <hi>perjured Juries,</hi> and all high Tranſgreſſors of the Laws and <hi>hainous</hi> offendors, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive his Majeſty of the <hi>fines,</hi> juſtly due unto him, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their <hi>right,</hi> we, the true Proteſtants, and his Majeſties <hi>loyal</hi> Subjects, were not in <hi>ſafety,</hi> nor able to live among <hi>ſuch Confederates</hi> of wickedneſs; but muſt, as King <hi>Boco</hi> ſaid to the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> depart thence, leſt the ire of the Gods,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106658:23"/> or the rage and injuſtice of ſuch men do utterly deſtroy us.

            <p>And I <hi>proteſted,</hi> and do proteſt, that I would be <hi>with the firſt,</hi> that would do my <hi>uttermoſt endeavour,</hi> to puniſh <hi>this Jury,</hi> and all falſe and <hi>forſworn</hi> perjured Juries, and the like <hi>high Tranſgreſſours,</hi> that concern me whatſoever.

            <p>It is moſt certain, that <hi>Impunitas peccati invitat homines ad malignandum;</hi>
               <note place="margin">And therefore I do believe, that I am as equally bound in conſcience, to puniſh this Jury, as I am to recover the Lands of the Church.</note> and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, becauſe the puniſhment is <hi>deferred,</hi> the hearts of the children of men are <hi>altogether</hi> ſet, to do evil; and my <hi>Divinity</hi> aſſureth me, that to <hi>puniſh</hi> a perjured perſon, and a <hi>tranſcendent</hi> Tranſgreſſour of the Law, is as <hi>acceptable</hi> unto God, as the <hi>relieving</hi> of the Oppreſſed; becauſe that hereby we do <hi>our beſt</hi> that thoſe, which will not be perſwaded by <hi>good Counſel</hi> to be honeſt, and <hi>vertuous,</hi> may be forced with <hi>ſtripes,</hi> to do their <hi>duties,</hi> or at leaſt terrified from being <hi>ſo vicious,</hi> for that as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Qui non vult duci debet trahi.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> in former times was very <hi>famous</hi> and glorious for <hi>many things</hi> eſpecially for <hi>Piety,</hi> and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly <hi>Charity,</hi> and bounty of the people one towards another, as it appeareth by the rare and many many Edifices of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> endowed with <hi>ample</hi> means and revenues, dedicated for the <hi>honour</hi> of God, and the ſervice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> all to be ſeen at this very day: for which cauſe it was wont to be <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and applauded, and by the bordering Nations, that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their <hi>ſedulity</hi> in pious works, and <hi>neglect</hi> of worldly pomp, when, as the holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> lived in <hi>Tents,</hi> ſo moſt of them were contented to lie in <hi>Booths,</hi> and poor earthly Cabins, or houſes made of <hi>Earth,</hi> that they might build to God houſes of <hi>Marble,</hi> moſt ſumptuous and glorious; and that they might be the better able, to beſtow the more, to <hi>adorn</hi> and beautifie the houſes and Temples of God; it was called, and not amiſs, <hi>Eccleſia Sanctorum,</hi> the glorious Church of holy Saints; that aimed only to go to heaven.</p>
            <p>But now ſince the <hi>unhappy time</hi> of that potent K. <hi>H.</hi> 8. when <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> through his diſcontent with the Pope, about his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce with Queen <hi>Katherine, Ut fama vagatur,</hi> began to get

            <p>For if you walk through <hi>Ireland,</hi> as I rode from <hi>Carlingford</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and from <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and in my <hi>Viſitation</hi> thrice over the Dioceſs of <hi>Oſſory;</hi> I believe that throughout all your travel, you ſhall find it as I found it, in all the waies that I went, ſcarce <hi>one Church</hi> ſtanding, and <hi>ſufficiently</hi> repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for ſeven, I ſpeak within compaſs, that are <hi>ruined,</hi> and have only <hi>walls,</hi> without ornaments, and moſt of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>roofs,</hi> without <hi>doors,</hi> without windows, but the holes to receive the winds to entertain the Congregation.</p>
            <p>And what a <hi>lamentable</hi> thing, and a miſerable ſight is this? If you ſay, that in the time of blindneſs the people were <hi>over zealous</hi> in building <hi>too many</hi> Churches, and thinking to merit much thereby: I ſay, that now, in the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of knowledge, and the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel, they are <hi>too riotous</hi> to pull them down, and <hi>too negligent</hi> of Gods honour, and of the Peoples good, to waſte and ruinate ſo <hi>many Churches,</hi> and to let the people <hi>want</hi> them to meet together, to ſerve God; which will merit a worſe reward for them, than they ſhall have that built them.</p>
            <p>You may remember, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> was to erect the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> in the wilderneſs, within a <hi>deſart place,</hi> of no trade or traffick, and therefore not eaſie to get <hi>any wealth</hi> in it: Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> requiring their <hi>aide</hi> and free will offering to do the ſame; they were ready, and <hi>ſo willing,</hi> every man, beyond his power, to bring in their oblation in ſuch <hi>abundance,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> was fain to tell them, they had brought enough, and <hi>too much:</hi> and therefore forbade them to bring in <hi>any more;</hi> he like a good man and <hi>juſt,</hi> being not deſirous to make any <hi>gain</hi> of their bounty.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106658:44"/>
               <p>But the Archbiſhops <hi>do receive</hi> from the Clergy of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Oſſory</hi> all the Procurations that they do <hi>yearly</hi> pay unto their Biſhops.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding this <hi>exemption</hi> of Refections by the <hi>Canon,</hi> I am ſure I paid ſeventeen pound for the <hi>Archdeacons</hi> refection in the Archbiſhops <hi>laſt Viſitation,</hi> which is a great deal more than the Subſidy and twentieth part that I pay unto <hi>his Majeſty</hi> any year, and it may be more than <hi>ever</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon a Dinner for the bleſſed Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you ſee in the <hi>Letter,</hi> how <hi>highly</hi> they do extoll the Biſhop of <hi>Kildare,</hi> which is the <hi>prime</hi> Biſhop in the Kingdom, for the <hi>noble</hi> entertainment that he made at this Viſitation, ſpending, as ſome ſay, forty pounds at leaſt for their <hi>Refection;</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Lachlin</hi> and <hi>Fernes</hi> in like manner, that was not <hi>much</hi> behind the former, to ſhew his love and <hi>reſpect</hi> to his Metrapolitan, my Lords <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly, I do <hi>honour,</hi> reſpect, and reverence, and do <hi>heartily</hi> love my Lords Grace of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as a moſt <hi>noble Gentleman,</hi> and a moſt reverend and a <hi>worthy Father</hi> of the Church, and as much, and it may be <hi>more</hi> than any of them, and have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſomewhat for the love I bare him; though my <hi>large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> for the rights of the Church darkened the <hi>expreſſion</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Archdeacons <hi>Refection,</hi> as the Archdeacon repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to his Grace.</p>
               <p>Or it may be, as ſome ſay, <hi>my Juriſdiction</hi> (for the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is <hi>mine,</hi> and not my Archdeacons, nor Regiſter,) was ſuſpended becauſe I <hi>appeared not,</hi> at the Viſitation, but went to <hi>England</hi> without my Lords Grace his leave; eſpecially after I had <hi>notice</hi> of his Viſitation.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I muſt <hi>confeſs,</hi> I went after I had <hi>notice</hi> of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation: but my <hi>only buſineſs</hi> was the buſineſs of the <hi>Church,</hi> and I had my Lord <hi>Lieutenants</hi> leave, under his hand and ſeal, to go without <hi>any prejudice</hi> unto me; neither was I ſo <hi>forgetful</hi> of my duty, or of civil reſpect, as to <hi>neglect</hi> my Lords Grace, but I went unto his Grace to excuſe my <hi>abſence</hi> from his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to deſire his leave, to go on my journey; and he <hi>very graciouſly</hi> yielded unto me.</p>

               <p>And why, after <hi>ſuch leaves</hi> obtained, my Juriſdiction, which is <hi>half</hi> my Epiſcopal Function, ſhould be inhibited, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not; If Mr. <hi>Bulkley</hi> ſaith, <hi>quomodo conſtat,</hi> that you had my Lords Grace leave to be abſent: I anſwer <hi>quomodo conſtabat,</hi> how did I know, that Mr. <hi>Archdeacon Bulkley</hi> ſhould viſite me, and would think me ſo <hi>uncivil,</hi> and ſo ill bred, as to <hi>forget</hi> my reſpect and duty to my <hi>Lords Grace,</hi> as to go away without his leave?</p>
               <p>I, but why did not you, ſaith the <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> ſend a Certificate under the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> hand, that you had his Grace his <hi>leave?</hi>

               <p>My Regiſters Letter informs me, that Mr. <hi>Cull Juniors</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings were ſequeſtred for going to the <hi>Univerſity</hi> without his Grace his <hi>leave,</hi> whereof I have ſpoken before; and others for <hi>diſtance</hi> of miles, if they were above <hi>ſix miles</hi> one from another, though they ſay, that for the <hi>tenuity</hi> of their Livings they had the Kings <hi>Pattent</hi> under the Broad Seal, to hold them ſome thirty, and others twenty miles diſtant; in which caſe, I ſay no more, but, if they ſhall not keep them above <hi>ſix miles diſtant,</hi> they might live better and grow richer here in <hi>Ireland</hi> by keeping <hi>Sheep,</hi> than by feeding of <hi>Chriſt his flock;</hi> or if the Law <hi>prohibits</hi> them, to keep them, <hi>beyond</hi> that diſtance, I wonder, why they are <hi>admitted,</hi> by the <hi>Relaxations</hi> of the Sequeſtrations, to keep them <hi>ſtill</hi> if they were ſequeſtred, to get <hi>Fees</hi> for the Relaxation, to Mr. <hi>Proby,</hi> my Lords Grace his Regiſter, and not to <hi>deprive</hi> them of either Living; my Lords Grace dealt more <hi>graciouſly,</hi> and like himſelf, in granting the <hi>Relaxation</hi> of them, than his Surrogate did in the <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>But if they were <hi>Sequeſtred,</hi> for not paying the Archbiſhops <hi>Procurations,</hi> or other duties due unto his Grace, I blame them <hi>very much,</hi> that they paid them not; for though by reaſon of the <hi>ſmalneſs</hi> of their means, and the <hi>worthineſs</hi> of the men, in

               <p>And I underſtand likewiſe, from the <hi>reſt</hi> of the Clergy, and the poor <hi>Clarks</hi> of the Pariſh Churches, what an <hi>infinite charge</hi> the reſt of the ſequeſtred parties had been at, in paying about thirty two ſhillings Fees for every <hi>Relaxation,</hi> and Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion granted againſt them; beſides their own <hi>proper</hi> expences, and, if I am not miſinformed, beſides two pence a mile from <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Oſſory,</hi> (which in ſome places is betwixt fifty and ſixty miles,) to the <hi>Apparator</hi> that ſerved the Sequeſtration; and beſides a far greater trouble and <hi>loſs</hi> which theſe ſequeſtred perſons had from the <hi>Tenants,</hi> to whom they had ſet their Tythes before they were ſequeſtred, and (by reaſon of the <hi>great charge,</hi> and ſmall means of ſome of them) were fain to take ſome part of their money <hi>before-hand;</hi> for when the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> of their Tythes, ſaw that their Livings were ſequeſtred, and put into other mens hands, yet, (though they had a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of them afterwards,) they pretended a far <hi>greater loſs</hi> than it may be they had, and ſo made the loſs <hi>very great</hi> unto the Incumbent, that muſt bear all the damage, and ſave the Tenant harmleſs; as to inſtance in one example for all.</p>
               <p>The Dean and Chapter having paid me <hi>no Procurations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An inſtance of the loſs of the ſequeſtred parties.</note> for all the Livings that they held, ſince his Majeſties happy reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I <hi>ſequeſtred</hi> the ſame into the hands of two of the ableſt and beſt experienced Prebends, Mr. <hi>Teate,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kerney,</hi> who, I knew, would give a <hi>juſt account</hi> to me, and to the reſt of their fellow Prebends; and they did ſet the Tythes unto thoſe Tenants that were <hi>moſt able,</hi> and gave <hi>moſt</hi> for them; but when Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley</hi> came to viſite the Chapter, his <hi>great friend,</hi> and old acquaintance, the <hi>Dean,</hi> that had all the <hi>former</hi> years Revenues in his hand, and had given <hi>none account</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:106658:52"/> of any part thereof unto the Chapter, and was much <hi>grieved</hi> at my Sequeſtration of it, out of his hands, would not <hi>pay</hi> the Procurations due to my Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> no more than he would pay to me any of my Procurations; whereupon Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley,</hi> whether to <hi>pleaſe</hi> the <hi>Deane,</hi> or to <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> his Coſin <hi>Bulkley,</hi> I know not, ſequeſtred the ſame again into the hands of his Coſin Mr. <hi>Thomas Bulkley,</hi> and the reſt of the Prebends had loſt no leſs than five pounds by reaſon of that Sequeſtration, if the Law had not forced Mr. <hi>Tho.

And ſo did the reſt of the Clergy loſe <hi>very much</hi> by reaſon of their Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, which they had never been acquainted with ſince my reſtauration; though I received not forty ſhillings from <hi>all my Clergy</hi> ſince I came to be Biſhop to this very day, nor ſo much as <hi>one penny</hi> from the Dean in all my life.</p>
               <p>Then about two months after the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> Viſitation was paſt, I received a Letter from Mr. <hi>Proby,</hi> the Archbiſhops Regiſter.</p>
               <p>And therein a Liſt of them that had not paid their Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations unto his Grace.</p>
               <p>At the reading of which, I did <hi>greatly</hi> wonder at the <hi>partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley,</hi> that could ſpare to ſequeſter Mr. <hi>Richard Seagar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whittington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Deane,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goburne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> that were the Deans friends, and for whom he interceded, though five of them were non-reſident, and yet would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſequeſter thoſe eight (whereof ſeven were alwaies reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and took moſt pains in all the Dioceſs,) whom he knew the Biſhop therefore had a very <hi>good opinion</hi> of them, as well as of thoſe whom he ſpared; and the Dean had ſo <hi>eagerly,</hi> I will not ſay <hi>maliciouſly,</hi> but I dare ſay <hi>cauſeleſly,</hi> complained of them; and theſe alſo to have their <hi>Relaxations</hi> granted before they had paid their <hi>Procurations;</hi> I hope it is not to ſequeſter them <hi>again,</hi> which they well <hi>deſerve,</hi> if their former warning hath not <hi>taught</hi> them to pay them. And therefore, I that have <hi>alwaies</hi> perſwaded and taught <hi>obedience</hi> to be obſerved by all inferiours to their <hi>ſuperintendents,</hi> would not be <hi>negligent</hi> of my
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106658:52"/> duty, to do according to my Lords Grace his Order, but I ſent my <hi>Apparitor</hi> to all the particulars of my Clergy mentioned in the Schedule, to come and make <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for their Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to expect what might <hi>ſucceed,</hi> which they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like wiſe men, to <hi>prevent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they, when they came unto me, ſhewed me their <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances,</hi> under Mr. <hi>Juxe</hi> his hand, that they had already paid them.</p>
               <p>So I thought this <hi>ſtorm</hi> was over: Yet within a while I heard that about ſome ten poor <hi>Pariſh Clarkes,</hi> and five of the Clergy were cited to appear at <hi>Dublin,</hi> (a journey to ſome fifty or ſixty miles, in the ſhort Winter daies, and over waies as foul as any is in <hi>Ingland,</hi>) to anſwer <hi>Articles</hi> that ſhould be objected againſt them.</p>
               <p>Then divers of the <hi>Clerks</hi> came crying to me, that they had rather leave their <hi>Clerkeſhip</hi> than to take ſuch a journey to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;</hi> and one of the Clerks the Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley</hi> had given a Licence to, and yet cited him to <hi>Dublin</hi> to ſhew his Licence, the which, when he ſhewed, the Officers of the Court ſaid, they <hi>miſtook</hi> it, and diſmiſt the cauſe, and yet afterwards ſent a Citation for the <hi>Fees.</hi> And my Clergy entreated me to <hi>intercede</hi> for them that did not know wherein they had <hi>offended,</hi> nor what could be <hi>objected</hi> againſt them: and I anſwered them all, that I would neither meddle nor make in their buſineſs; but, if they have done well, then all would be <hi>well,</hi> if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let them ſuffer for it, I would never <hi>excuſe</hi> their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, nor <hi>Patronize</hi> their offence; then ſome of them appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at <hi>Dublin,</hi> expecting their Charge, and deſiring earneſtly to be diſpatcht, Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley</hi> anſwered, Your Biſhop is writing of Books, (for he had ſome inkling of mine intent,) and will not apply himſelf to my Lords Grace to <hi>intercede</hi> for you.</p>
               <p>Yet my Lord Archbiſhop very <hi>nobly</hi> and <hi>graciouſly</hi> willed the Archdeacon to take their <hi>anſwer,</hi> and to diſpatch them that they might go <hi>home;</hi> and the Archdeacon <hi>Bulkley</hi> willed them, to <hi>confeſs</hi> their faults, and to ſubmit unto the Court, and they ſhould be diſcharged; and I hearing of this advice, willed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106658:53"/> them to confeſs the <hi>truth,</hi> but not of any guilt, wherein they were <hi>innocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore when they had their Articles, ten or twelve, read unto them, (for they had no Copy of them,) they ſaw, they were but meer <hi>ſuggeſtions,</hi> and not any thing in any of them, that could any waies touch them, or prejudice them in any thing, and they preſently made their anſwers unto them.</p>
               <p>And when they had anſwered and confeſt <hi>no fault</hi> that they committed; upon the payment of their Fees, for the charges of the Court, they were diſmiſt.</p>
               <p>Whereby, it ſeems to me, that, if they were guiltleſs, and nothing could be proved againſt them, they might as well cite all the Clergy, and all the men in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and ſuggeſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt them, to bring them unto <hi>Dublin,</hi> to pay <hi>Fees</hi> to enrich the Officers of the Court; and that being done, to ſend them home <hi>glad</hi> that they are diſmiſt.</p>
               <p>Then after this the Churchwardens of S. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> having very juſtly, as I underſtand, <hi>preſented</hi> divers perſons at the Archbiſhops Viſitation,<note place="margin">Canon 65. and 67.</note> they were, contrary to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> cited to appear at <hi>Dublin,</hi> forty ſeven miles, to make good their Preſentation, as the Churchwardens informed me; which was ſo ill reſented, that we could <hi>hardly</hi> get any that would take the <hi>Churchwardenſhip</hi> upon them, for fear of the like troubles if they preſented any man. But, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Archdeacon why the Churchwardens were cited to make good their Preſentment: He anſwered, it was not ſo; but they retained a <hi>Proctor</hi> to proſecute againſt thoſe that refuſed to pay the <hi>Church taxes,</hi> and they not following their ſuit, they were ſent unto, either to come and <hi>proſecute,</hi> or the Defendants ſhould be <hi>diſmiſt:</hi> which if ſo, I blame not the proceeding, but let the Churchwardens ſuffer for their own errour, when they ſue out of my Court without a diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or an appeal.</p>
               <p>Yet out of all <hi>my former diſcourſe,</hi> it appeareth what an <hi>heavy burthen</hi> and an infinite charge this laſt triennial Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Archbiſhop hath been to the <hi>indigent Clergy</hi> of <hi>Oſſory,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:106658:53"/> both in their <hi>threefold</hi> Procurations, their <hi>manifold</hi> Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>long</hi> Winter journeys to procure their Relaxations, and the <hi>manifold</hi> loſſes that they ſuſtained by their Tenants, that, by reaſon of the Sequeſtrations were diſappointed of thoſe tythes that they had taken from the Incumbents, which makes me think, that we do not follow our Saviours Counſel and Precept to S. <hi>Peter, To feed his flock;</hi> nor what we learnt in the old Adage, that ſaith, <hi>Boni paſtoris eſt pecus tondere non deglubere;</hi> for certainly theſe foreſaid things do ſeem <hi>deglubere pecus non tondere;</hi> and to cauſe his ſhepwards to <hi>ſtarve,</hi> and not to enable them to <hi>feed</hi> his Lambs.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as the ſin of <hi>Solomon</hi> moved God to raiſe up <hi>Hadad</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> and <hi>Rezon</hi> the Son of <hi>Eliadah,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> to vex <hi>Solomon</hi> for the ſins of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 1 Kings 11.14, 23, 26. So I do not wonder, that God ſuffereth the devil to ſtir up <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to vex the Biſhops.</note> and other <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> Sectaries to vex the <hi>Biſhops</hi> for theſe and the like ſins of the Biſhops againſt God and his poor people, when they ſuffer and <hi>countenance</hi> their Commiſſaries, Regiſters, and other Officers, to be like a <hi>talent of lead</hi> upon the necks of Chriſt his Sheep.</p>
               <p>But I do therefore demand, if theſe things,<note place="margin">Whether the foreſaid abuſes ought not to be redreſſed.</note> and all the things I ſhewed to be amiſs in this Treatiſe, ought not to be <hi>reformed</hi> and amended?</p>
               <p>I know ſome will ſay, they ought not <hi>thus</hi> to be publiſhed to the World, to diſcover the weakneſs and <hi>imperfections</hi> of our Brethren, to make them <hi>more contemptible</hi> in the eyes of the ſcoffers of our Calling, than they are; and therefore will much <hi>blame</hi> me for this my publication of theſe things.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Caligula</hi> was ſo wicked, and his life ſo <hi>beaſtly,</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. That ſeeing ſo many great and goodly <hi>Impropriations</hi> are taken away from the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, and from the <hi>ſervice</hi> of God, and are held in the hands of ſuch great perſons and <hi>powerful</hi> men, that will not part with them, (as I ſhewed to you before,) and the poor Vicars of ſuch Rectories impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, have ſcarce ſo much <hi>means</hi> belonging to the Vicaredges, as will put bread into their mouths, whereby they are <hi>conſtrained,</hi> for the relief of their Families, to take <hi>Farms,</hi> and other Lands to occupy, like Lay men, and to neglect their <hi>duties,</hi> and the <hi>ſervice</hi> of Gods Church, and to ſuffer the poor people either to be inſtructed, and to have their children <hi>baptized,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106658:55"/> married,</hi> and <hi>buried</hi> by the Popiſh Prieſts, or to have <hi>no Prieſts</hi> at all; and we that are the <hi>Dioceſſans,</hi> by reaſon of the ſmall values of thoſe Vicaredges, can find no men that are worthy and <hi>able Ministers,</hi> that will come and accept of thoſe <hi>ſlender</hi> maintenances; and thoſe that do <hi>accept</hi> them, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them, by reaſon of their ſmalneſs, to <hi>diſcharge them;</hi> And ſeeing, as I ſaid, the Churches are <hi>down,</hi> and the Lands, Livings, and Revenues of the Church, are <hi>thus,</hi> as I ſhewed, in the hands of the great and <hi>powerful</hi> men, and rich Cities, and we can as eaſily pluck the club out of <hi>Hercules</hi> hands, as get any of them out of their fingers, when the poor men dare not, ſcarce, <hi>aske</hi> their dues of them, or if they ſue for them, the <hi>remedy</hi> will prove far worſe than the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> to go to Law with <hi>Corporations,</hi> or with <hi>mighty</hi> men, to ſpend their <hi>money,</hi> and commonly to go without their <hi>right,</hi> as they have a <hi>plain-example</hi> in my proceedings with Sir <hi>George Ayskue,</hi> and the detention of all my Procurations, (which, as Biſhop <hi>Bale</hi> ſaith, in the Page of his Book, was almoſt half the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Biſhopprick of <hi>Oſſory,</hi>) by the foreſaid great men and Cities ever ſince his Majeſties reſtauration; and I know not how to get them; it is no wonder to me, that <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ſhould, not only <hi>continue,</hi> but encreaſe more and more, and the Service of God <hi>decay</hi> more and more, and injuſtice, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and wickedneſs <hi>abound</hi> in this Kingdom more and more, and I tell you herein the <hi>plain truth;</hi> let who will be angry, and let others think what they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>And further, ſeeing, that beſide the payments and taxes that they are bound to pay to his Majeſty by the hand of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and to their Biſhop, and Archbiſhop, and all other pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their Churches, they are <hi>frequently,</hi> contrary to the Acts of Parliament, <hi>exceedingly</hi> moleſted, taxed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, for the ſame taxes, which they have formerly paid, by the Lay Collectors: and the trouble to be diſcharged from thoſe unjuſt Taxations is worſe, then the repayment of them again, when as <hi>exceſſit medicina modum,</hi> the remedy is worſe than the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore that it would pleaſe his Majeſty, for the honour
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106658:56"/> of God, and the good of the poor people, and the poor Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy likewiſe, to cauſe the Churches to be built<note n="*" place="margin">Eſpecially the Biſhops Cathedral Church at <hi>Kilkenny.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſeeing three or four Viſitations, that may be, of the Archdeacon, Biſhop, Archbiſhop, and Primate, in one year cannot chooſe but be a <hi>grievance</hi> and a great <hi>burthen</hi> unto the poor Clergy, that are poor enough without the charge of <hi>ſo many</hi> Viſitations, added unto the reſt of their taxes: That it would pleaſe his Majeſty to cauſe the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be brought to the ſame form, manner, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, that is uſed in the Church of <hi>Ingland,</hi> that is, for the Archdeacon to Viſit for <hi>two years,</hi> and the Biſhop to viſit every <hi>third year,</hi> and then the Archdeacons Viſitation to <hi>ceaſe</hi> for that year the Biſhop viſits, and the Archbiſhop to viſit <hi>once</hi> in his time, and both the Archdeacons and the Biſhops Viſitations to <hi>ceaſe</hi> when the Archbiſhop ſhall viſit.</p>
               <p>And <hi>thus</hi> the Clergy and the Church-Officers ſhall have but <hi>one</hi> Viſitation, <hi>quot annis,</hi> in every one year; which I think is <hi>very ſufficient</hi> for the rectifying of <hi>all abuſes,</hi> and for the far greater <hi>eaſe</hi> both of the Clergy and Layty: and which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, none ſhould be againſt the ſame, unleſs it be <hi>ſuch,</hi> as are <hi>too miſerably</hi> covetous; for a <hi>ſmall matter</hi> unto themſelves, to bring a <hi>heavy grievance</hi> to very many; which for my part, the Lord knoweth, that I never liked it; and I ſuppoſe, it ſhould be for the <hi>honour</hi> and praiſe of the <hi>Chief Governours</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, as we are ſtiled, to deal with our <hi>Clergy</hi> as with our <hi>Children,</hi> to eaſe them what we can, and not to make them <hi>faſt</hi> for our <hi>feasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I find great reaſon, that we ſhould in all things here in <hi>Ireland</hi> conform our ſelves to the Church of <hi>Ingland;</hi> for as

               <p>And therefore I wonder what hath altered or hindered this our conformity with the Church of <hi>Ingland,</hi> unleſs it be pride, covetouſneſs, or ambition, <hi>&amp; aviditas dominandi;</hi> which are weeds fitter to be rooted out of Churchmens hearts than to be cheriſhed in the Primates of Gods Church, and which I verily believe are now far enough from the thoughts of our moſt grave and moſt religious Archbiſhops, who, as I hope, will moſt eaſily yield to this conformity, that neither the Biſhops be ſo abridged in their Juriſdictions, nor their Clergy ſo much oppreſſed in their Viſitations, as they have been.</p>
               <p>Yet here I would not have my Reader to imagine that I ſpeak for the eaſe or remittance of the Procurations, Taxes, or other Impoſitions, of them that hold the Abbies, Priories, and Impropriate Rectories, which they have for nothing, and as it appears to me, contrary to all divine right; and therefore ſhould pay the ſame continually every year to them that do the Service of God: but I ſpeak it only for the eaſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the poor incumbent Rectors and Vicars that labour and take pains for the good of Gods people, and for the ſaving of their ſouls that hold their means from them.</p>
               <p>And, if this may not be done, to reduce the Government of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the ſame form, and after the ſame manner as the Church of <hi>Ingland</hi> is governed, yet that the Archbiſhops and Biſhops ſhould take ſpecial care to ſee that their Surrogates, Chancellours, and Deputies ſhould not any waies to enrich their Friends, Officers, and Servants, and to feaſt themſelves, oppreſs the poor Clergy, and others the poor Servants and Officers of the Church of Chriſt. I doubt not,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106658:57"/> but the Biſhops and the Archbiſhops are all juſt, and merciful, and tender-hearted towards all their inferiour Clergy; and can no waies be juſtly blamed for the faults of their ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Officers or Deputies, which they are ignorant of; And I do profeſs without flattery, and in the word of a Chriſtian, that my Lords Grace of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in all that he did, or ſaid, was ſo noble, juſt, and gracious towards thoſe honeſt Clergy men, whom his Archdeacon ſo ſeverely trounced, that the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the leaſt blame cannot be laid upon him.

               <p>And now to conclude our ſad condition, when, after all my many years ſufferings, and had ſpent above four hundred pounds to repair the Quire and Chancel of S. <hi>Kenny,</hi> and about ſix hundred pounds in Law againſt Sir <hi>George Ayskue</hi> for the right of the Church, and did perceive the ſucceſs like to be fruitleſs, I once thought to preſent this Petition to his Majeſty.</p>
